### Marketing Campaign Analysis

Scenario - Business Case
In this case, we are dealing with some account types, where there are normal ways in which sales are created and we have marketing tactics that we can utilize to drive the sales, such as Flyers, Emails, Phones and Visits. However some of these tactics are going to work with some of the accounts better than others, not all marketing tactics are equally effective.

This project has as a objetcive to help we answer these questions:
- What is the impact of each marketing strategy and sales visit on Sales (Amount Collected)?
- Is the same strategy valid for all the different client types?

Where should we invest more?
From the analysis we see that many of the factors correlate with the accounts collected. The tactics that were able to drive the most significant return on investment were the sales contacts. Placing more investment in these areas would benefit an overall campaign.
